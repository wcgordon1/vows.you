Your voice, your pacing, and your emotions all work differently when you speak versus when you read silently. Practice out loud multiple times.\n\n## Time Yourself\n\nKnow how long your vows take.

Having a sense of timing helps you pace yourself on the day.\n\n## Practice with Emotion\n\nDon't just read the words mechanically. Let yourself feel what you're saying.

Know where you might need to take a breath. Consider having a handkerchief or tissues nearby. Crying is beautiful, not something to be embarrassed about.\n\n## Practice Eye Contact\n\nOn your ceremony day, you'll want to look at your partner, not just stare at your paper. Practice looking up between sentences. Some people print their vows in a larger font to make this easier.\n\n## Don't Over-Practice\n\nYou want to feel familiar with your vows, not robotic.

You want to sound natural, like you're speaking from the heart.\n\n## Trust Yourself\n\nBy the time you're standing up there, you'll have lived with these words for a while. Trust that they'll come.
