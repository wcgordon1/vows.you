Your voice, your pacing, and your emotions all work differently when you speak versus when you read silently. Practice out loud multiple times.\n\n## Time Yourself\n\nKnow how long your vows take. Most vows should be 1 to 3 minutes. If yours are running long, edit. If they're very short, consider adding more. Having a sense of timing helps you pace yourself on the day.\n\n## Practice with Emotion\n\nDon't just read the words mechanically. Let yourself feel what you're saying. This will help you identify the moments where you might get choked up, so they don't surprise you at the altar.\n\n## Plan for Tears\n\nIf you're someone who cries, that's okay. Build in pauses. Know where you might need to take a breath. Consider having a handkerchief or tissues nearby. Crying is beautiful, not something to be embarrassed about.\n\n## Practice Eye Contact\n\nOn your ceremony day, you'll want to look at your partner, not just stare at your paper. Practice looking up between sentences. Some people print their vows in a larger font to make this easier.\n\n## Don't Over-Practice\n\nYou want to feel familiar with your vows, not robotic. A few run-throughs each day in the week before your wedding is enough. You want to sound natural, like you're speaking from the heart.\n\n## Trust Yourself\n\nBy the time you're standing up there, you'll have lived with these words for a while. Trust that they'll come.
