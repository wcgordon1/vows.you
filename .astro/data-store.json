Both options have meaning. Here's how to decide.\n\n## Traditional Vows\n\nTraditional vows have been spoken by countless couples before you. \"To have and to hold, from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do us part.\"\n\nThere's power in these words. They connect you to generations of married couples. They carry weight precisely because they're timeless.\n\n## Personal Vows\n\nPersonal vows are unique to your relationship. They tell your story, name your specific promises, and speak directly to who your partner is. They feel more intimate because they could only be about the two of you.\n\n## Questions to Consider\n\nHow public are you with your emotions? Personal vows require vulnerability in front of an audience. Some couples thrive on this. Others prefer to keep their deepest feelings private.\n\nWhat does your partner want? You should be on the same page. If one of you writes personal vows and the other reads traditional ones, the ceremony can feel unbalanced.\n\nWhat does your ceremony context require? Some religious traditions expect specific vows. Check with your officiant about what flexibility you have.\n\n## The Middle Path\n\nYou can do both. Some couples include traditional vows as part of the ceremony and add personal words before or after.

Delivering them well is the other half. Here's how to practice so you feel ready.\n\n## Read Aloud, Not Just in Your Head\n\nThe first time you read your vows aloud might feel awkward. That's normal. Your voice, your pacing, and your emotions all work differently when you speak versus when you read silently. Practice out loud multiple times.\n\n## Time Yourself\n\nKnow how long your vows take. Most vows should be 1 to 3 minutes. If yours are running long, edit. If they're very short, consider adding more. Having a sense of timing helps you pace yourself on the day.\n\n## Practice with Emotion\n\nDon't just read the words mechanically. Let yourself feel what you're saying. This will help you identify the moments where you might get choked up, so they don't surprise you at the altar.\n\n## Plan for Tears\n\nIf you're someone who cries, that's okay. Build in pauses. Know where you might need to take a breath. Consider having a handkerchief or tissues nearby. Crying is beautiful, not something to be embarrassed about.\n\n## Practice Eye Contact\n\nOn your ceremony day, you'll want to look at your partner, not just stare at your paper. Practice looking up between sentences. Some people print their vows in a larger font to make this easier.\n\n## Don't Over-Practice\n\nYou want to feel familiar with your vows, not robotic. A few run-throughs each day in the week before your wedding is enough. You want to sound natural, like you're speaking from the heart.\n\n## Trust Yourself\n\nBy the time you're standing up there, you'll have lived with these words for a while. Trust that they'll come.
