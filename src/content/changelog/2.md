Say hello to **practice mode** — your personal rehearsal space for reading your vows out loud before the big day. No more guessing whether your vows are too long, too short, or just right.

**Key Highlights:**

- **Read Time Estimate:** See exactly how long your vows will take to read at a natural pace — updated in real time as you write.
- **Section Breakdown:** Get timing for your opening, stories, promises, and closing so you can balance each part.
- **Sweet Spot Guidance:** We'll let you know if you're in the 2-3 minute range that most officiants recommend.
- **Confidence Builder:** Read your vows aloud, hear how they flow, and make edits until they feel right.

Too short feels rushed. Too long loses the room. Practice mode helps you hit the sweet spot so you can speak with confidence on your wedding day.
