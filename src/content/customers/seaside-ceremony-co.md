## We didn’t want perfect vows. We wanted *our* vows.

**We were stuck in the “rewrite loop”**

We thought writing vows would be this sweet, romantic thing. Instead, we spiraled. We wrote a few lines, deleted them, and kept telling ourselves we’d “get back to it tomorrow.” Every template we found sounded polished, but not personal. And the pressure of reading them out loud made it worse.

**The prompts didn’t write for us. They unlocked us.**

What surprised us was how human the questions felt. It wasn’t “describe your partner in three adjectives.” It was the kind of stuff that actually brings your relationship back to life: the first time you felt safe with them, the weird little traditions, the moment you knew this was your person.

Once we had those answers, the vows basically wrote themselves—because the material was real.

**It helped us sound sincere, not scripted**

We wanted heartfelt, but not overly dramatic. Funny, but not like a stand-up set. vows.you made it easy to find that middle ground. We could tweak the tone line by line, and every edit still sounded like *us*, not a copy-and-paste version of what vows are “supposed” to sound like.

**The timing check saved us from ourselves**

My first draft was… long. Like “someone please cut the mic” long.

The read-time estimate and practice mode were the reality check we needed. We trimmed, practiced twice, and landed at a length that felt emotional but respectful of the moment. Walking into the ceremony, we weren’t nervous about rambling—we were excited.

If you’re trying to write vows and you keep ending up with either a generic paragraph or a novel, vows.you is the difference between “we should really start” and “we’re ready.” It helped us say the true stuff, keep it tight, and show up confident.
