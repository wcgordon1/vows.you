## From blank page to vows that felt like us

**We wanted personal vows, not generic lines**

We knew we wanted to write our own vows, but the moment we tried, we froze. Everything we found online sounded like a greeting card, and we didn’t want to stand up in front of everyone and read something that didn’t feel like us.

**The prompts pulled out the real stuff**

What made vows.you work for us was how simple the process felt. The questions weren’t overwhelming. They nudged us toward the memories, tiny moments, and promises that actually describe our relationship. Once we had those pieces, the words started coming naturally.

**Structure and timing made it ceremony-ready**

The structure was exactly what we needed: an opening, our story, promises, and a close. That format kept us from rambling. And the read-time estimate was huge. We practiced a couple times, made a few edits, and ended up right around two minutes each. We felt calm instead of rushed.

If you’re staring at a blank page and worried you’ll either sound cheesy or go too long, vows.you is the first thing we’ve tried that truly made writing vows feel manageable. Our vows felt like us, and we were actually excited to read them.
