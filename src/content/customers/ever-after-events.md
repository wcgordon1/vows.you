## We had feelings. We had memories. We did *not* have vows.

**We kept writing “nice” lines that didn’t feel like us**

We’re not dramatic people. We love each other deeply, but we don’t talk in poetic quotes. Every time we tried to write vows, we ended up with lines that sounded like a wedding montage. It was polished, but it wasn’t personal. And we could feel it.

**The promise prompts were the turning point**

The moment it clicked was when vows.you moved us from “talk about love” to “make promises that match your life.” It asked the kind of questions that force you to get specific:

- What do you want to protect in this relationship?
- How do you show up when things are stressful?
- What do you want them to always be able to count on?

Once we answered those, our vows stopped being generic and started sounding like the way we actually love each other.

**It helped us keep the best parts and cut the rest**

We both had drafts that were way too long. Not because we were trying to show off. We just didn’t know what to keep. vows.you made editing feel simple: keep the lines that are vivid, remove the filler, and stay inside a timing range that works for a ceremony.

The read-time estimate saved us from rambling. The structure kept us from bouncing around. And practice mode made us feel like we could actually deliver it without shaking.
