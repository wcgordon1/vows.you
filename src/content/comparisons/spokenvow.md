## Overview: Vows.you vs SpokenVow {#overview}

[SpokenVow](https://www.spokenvow.com/) is a paid speech writing platform that covers wedding vows, toasts, best man speeches, maid of honor speeches, and more. It starts at $49 and uses what they call VowAI to create drafts, then runs those drafts through "four critics" including an authenticity critic that flags cliches and borrowed sentiment. They also have a free tools page with items like a speech scorer, cliche detector, outline generator, timer, word counter, and opening lines.

Vows.you focuses only on vows. It provides guided prompts that help you write, cliche detection that flags vow-specific mistakes, a practice teleprompter, and adaptive personalization that learns your style. The core difference is scope and model. SpokenVow is a speech platform that includes vows. Vows.you is a vow tool that goes deep on the full writing-to-delivery workflow. If you need help with your best man speech and your vows, SpokenVow covers both. If you care most about your vows and want the tightest workflow for writing, reviewing, practicing, and getting tailored suggestions, vows.you is purpose-built for that.

- SpokenVow: paid speech platform covering vows, toasts, and other speeches
- Vows.you: free, vow-focused workflow with writing, review, practice, and adaptive personalization
- Both address cliche detection, but from different angles

## What Vows.you and SpokenVow each do well {#strengths}

SpokenVow has a thoughtful approach. The "four critics" concept, including an authenticity critic that flags borrowed sentiment, shows they care about quality beyond just generating words. Their free tools page offers useful standalone items like a speech scorer and cliche detector with no account required. For people who need help across multiple speech types, having one platform is convenient. The paid service positions itself as professional-grade speech writing help.

Vows.you is narrower and deeper on vows specifically. The cliche detection is tailored to vow mistakes, not general speech cliches. The guided prompts are designed around the structure of wedding vows: reflections, promises, and closing. The practice teleprompter with speed presets, fullscreen, and mirror mode is built into the same workflow. And vows.you learns your style over time, so suggestions become more tailored the more you write and refine. That end-to-end focus on one type of content means fewer decisions and a more streamlined experience for someone who just wants to write great vows.

- SpokenVow: multi-speech coverage, critic-based review, free standalone tools
- Vows.you: vow-specific cliche detection, guided prompts, practice, and adaptive personalization in one flow

## Biggest drawbacks of SpokenVow {#drawbacks}

SpokenVow is strong for speeches overall, but vows are one category inside a broader speech platform. That means the tools and workflow are built to serve multiple use cases, not optimized for one.

Their critics approach is promising, but it is not the same as a vows-focused workflow where template, review, practice, and adaptive personalization all work together in a single flow. The pieces exist separately. Free tools like the cliche detector and timer are useful on their own, but the full vow writing experience appears tied to their paid service and account setup. At $49 or more, that is a meaningful commitment for something you might only use once. Their cliche detection may catch generic cliches, but it is not clear whether it is tailored to vow-specific mistakes the way vows.you is. Speech cliches and vow cliches overlap, but they are not identical. "You are my rock" and "forever and always" are specifically vow problems. A general speech detector might not weight them the same way.

- Vows are one category inside a broader speech platform
- Full writing flow appears tied to paid tiers and account creation
- Cliche detection may be general speech oriented rather than vow-specific
- Free tools are standalone, not integrated into one vow workflow

## Vows.you features that matter in real ceremonies {#vows-you-features}

When it comes to ceremony day, the features that matter are the ones that keep you from reading generic vows too fast with shaking hands.

Cliche detection catches weak phrases before your partner hears them. The [free vows template](https://www.vows.you/wedding-vows-template) asks guided prompts and produces a clear, modern vow about two minutes long. Click highlights show you better options and prompt you to add personal details. The [practice tool](https://www.vows.you/practice-wedding-vows) is a teleprompter with word-by-word highlighting, speed presets, fullscreen, and mirror mode. Vows.you reflects your choices and edits over time, so the more you write and refine, the more tailored the suggestions become. Everything runs in your browser. Your vows are never sent to a server. That privacy layer matters when you are writing the most personal thing you will ever say out loud.

- Cliche detection and weak phrase highlighting
- Length and read-time feedback while you write
- Practice teleprompter with speed presets and mirror mode
- Learns your style and improves suggestions over time
- Privacy: everything stays in your browser

## Vows.you vs SpokenVow writing quality and "sounds like you" {#writing-quality}

SpokenVow generates a draft and runs it through critics, including one that checks for authenticity. That is a solid concept. Having multiple perspectives review a draft can catch issues a single pass misses.

Vows.you takes a different approach. Instead of generating a draft and then critiquing it, vows.you helps you write the draft yourself through guided prompts. Then it flags cliches and weak phrases in your own words. The difference is authorship. With SpokenVow, you are editing an AI draft. With vows.you, you are writing your own words and getting feedback to sharpen them. Both can produce good results. But vows that start from your own memories and details tend to sound more like you than vows that start from an AI draft you edit down. The authenticity comes from the starting point as much as the editing process.

- SpokenVow: AI draft plus multi-critic review
- Vows.you: guided prompts for your own draft plus cliche and phrase feedback
- Starting from your own words often produces more authentic results
- Both approaches can work, but the process shapes the outcome

## Cliches and common vow mistakes: Vows.you vs SpokenVow {#cliches}

"You are my rock." "I knew from the moment I met you." "I promise to love you through good times and bad." These show up in vow after vow because they feel safe to write.

SpokenVow mentions an authenticity critic that flags cliches and borrowed sentiment. That is a meaningful feature. But it is not clear whether their detector is tuned specifically for vow mistakes or for general speech patterns. Vows.you is built around vow-specific cliches. "You are my rock" gets flagged because it appears in a huge percentage of vow drafts. "Forever and always" gets flagged because it sounds beautiful but says nothing specific. The tool prompts you to replace these with real moments. Instead of "you are my rock," try "you are the person who sat on the kitchen floor with me when I got bad news." That level of specificity is what separates vows that land from vows that float by.

- SpokenVow has an authenticity critic, but its vow-specificity is unclear
- Vows.you flags vow-specific cliches and prompts specific replacements
- "You are my rock" and "forever and always" are the two most common vow cliches
- The fix is always the same: replace the generic phrase with a real moment

## Length and pacing: keeping vows to 1 to 2 minutes {#length}

Run past two minutes and you lose the room. Stay under two minutes and every word hits harder.

SpokenVow has a free timer and word counter tool on their site, which is useful for checking length. Vows.you builds read-time feedback directly into the writing experience. You see your word count and estimated read time update as you type. The difference is integration. SpokenVow's timer is a standalone tool you use separately. Vows.you shows the number while you are actively writing and editing, so you can make length decisions in real time instead of checking after the fact.

- Target: 150 to 300 words, about 1 to 2 minutes
- SpokenVow: free timer and word counter as standalone tools
- Vows.you: live read-time feedback built into the writing experience
- Integrated feedback during writing is more actionable than a separate tool

## Practicing and delivery: reading out loud without rushing {#practice}

Writing is half the job. The other half is standing up and saying the words without your voice cracking, your hands shaking, and your pace sprinting through the best lines.

The vows.you [practice tool](https://www.vows.you/practice-wedding-vows) is a teleprompter designed for this moment. It scrolls your vows at a pace you set, highlights each word, supports fullscreen for zero distractions, and has mirror mode for simulating a stage view. Speed presets help you retrain your pace because nearly everyone reads 30 to 40 percent faster under adrenaline. SpokenVow does not clearly list a teleprompter-style practice tool. Their free tools include a timer, which helps with length, but timing yourself is not the same as practicing delivery with guided pacing.

- Practice out loud at least five times before the ceremony
- Speed presets retrain your pace when nerves speed you up
- Fullscreen and mirror mode simulate the real moment
- SpokenVow does not clearly offer a teleprompter practice tool

## Personalization: Vows.you learns your style {#personalization}

Most speech platforms treat every user the same way. You get the same flow, the same prompts, and the same output structure no matter how many drafts you write.

Vows.you is different. It reflects your choices and edits over time. The more you write, refine, and select, the more the tool learns what sounds like you. Fewer generic suggestions. More prompts that match your voice. After a few sessions, it stops feeling like a template and starts feeling like a writing partner who knows your tendencies. SpokenVow does not clearly advertise this kind of adaptive personalization in their workflow.

- Vows.you learns from your edits and choices over time
- Suggestions become more tailored to your voice with each session
- SpokenVow does not clearly feature adaptive personalization

## Pricing and access: Vows.you vs SpokenVow {#pricing}

SpokenVow starts at $49 for their paid speech writing service. Free tools like the speech scorer, cliche detector, timer, and outline generator are available without an account. But the full AI writing and critic review flow is behind a paywall.

Vows.you free tools, including the [vow template](https://www.vows.you/wedding-vows-template), [vow review](https://www.vows.you/free-wedding-vow-review), and [practice tool](https://www.vows.you/practice-wedding-vows), do not require an account or payment. You start immediately in your browser.

- SpokenVow: starts at $49 for the full service, free standalone tools
- Vows.you: free tools with no account required
- SpokenVow charges for the integrated workflow. Vows.you offers it for free.

## My take after reading a lot of vows {#author-take}

After watching couples struggle with this, one pattern is clear. The people who end up happiest with their vows are not the best writers. They are the ones who were most specific.

A vow that says "I promise to support your dreams" is fine. A vow that says "I promise to sit in the audience at every open mic night, even when the comedy is terrible" is something people remember. The specificity is what makes it real. And that specificity usually comes out during the editing process, not the first draft. First drafts are almost always full of safe, borrowed language. The magic happens in round two and three, when you start replacing general statements with actual moments from your life together.

On delivery, SpokenVow and vows.you both understand this matters. But the approach is different. SpokenVow focuses on the writing quality through critic feedback. Vows.you goes further by giving you a teleprompter to actually practice the delivery. Both pieces matter. Writing great vows that you stumble through is almost as bad as writing average vows and delivering them smoothly. The ideal is strong words delivered with confidence, and that requires both good editing and real practice.

- Specificity matters more than writing skill
- "I promise to support your dreams" vs "I promise to sit in the audience at every open mic night"
- First drafts are full of safe language. The magic is in rounds two and three.
- Great writing plus poor delivery is almost as bad as average writing with smooth delivery

## Who should pick Vows.you vs SpokenVow {#who-should-pick}

If you need help with multiple wedding speeches and want a professional service that covers vows, toasts, and more, SpokenVow makes sense. Their multi-critic approach shows genuine care about quality, and the paid service positions itself as comprehensive speech help.

If your priority is writing great vows and you want a focused, free workflow that takes you from blank page to ceremony day, vows.you is the better fit. The vow-specific cliche detection, guided prompts, practice teleprompter, and adaptive personalization work together in a way that a general speech platform does not match. People who want to write their own words, get feedback that improves over time, and practice delivery will get the most from vows.you.

- SpokenVow is best for people who need help with multiple speech types
- Vows.you is best for people focused on writing and delivering great vows
- You could use SpokenVow's free cliche detector alongside vows.you's full workflow
