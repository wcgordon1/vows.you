qaItems:
  - q: "Which is better for avoiding cliches?"

  - q: "Which is better if I freeze on a blank page?"
    a: "Both help. Easy Peasy gives you a form to fill in and generates a draft. Vows.you uses guided prompts to walk you through the writing process step by step and produces a structured vow."

  - q: "Which helps me practice reading out loud?"
    a: "Vows.you has a practice teleprompter with speed presets, fullscreen, and mirror mode. Easy Peasy does not include a practice tool."
  - q: "Which helps me print vows cleanly?"
    a: "Vows.you has a vow cards tool that exports PDF as a 4x6 card or half-letter booklet. Easy Peasy does not offer print formatting."

faqItems:
  - q: "Are wedding vow generators worth it?"
    a: "They can be if they help you find your own voice. A generator that just fills in blanks will produce generic vows. One that gives you structure, feedback, and editing tools will help you write something that sounds like you."
  - q: "How do I avoid cliche wedding vows?"
    a: "Cut phrases you have heard before. 'You are my rock,' 'forever and always,' and 'you complete me' show up in most drafts. Replace them with a specific memory only your partner would recognize."
  - q: "How long should vows be?"
    a: "About 1 to 2 minutes when read out loud, roughly 150 to 300 words. Shorter vows land better because they are easier to deliver calmly."
  - q: "How many promises should I include?"
    a: "Two or three. More than that and the audience loses track. Focus on promises that feel specific to your relationship."
  - q: "How do I practice vows without rushing?"
    a: "Read them out loud at least five times. Use a teleprompter with speed presets to train yourself to slow down. Plan pauses between sections."
  - q: "Can I practice on my phone?"
    a: "Yes. The vows.you practice tool works on any device with a browser, including fullscreen and mirror mode."
  - q: "Can I print vows as cards or a booklet?"
    a: "Yes. Vows.you generates a PDF in 4x6 card or half-letter booklet format with background, overlay, and font options. Everything is generated in your browser."
  - q: "Do my vows stay private?"
    a: "On vows.you, yes. Your vows stay in the browser and nothing is sent to a server. No account or login is required for the free tools."
  - q: "What if I am not a strong writer?"
    a: "That is who these tools are for. Vows.you uses guided prompts that ask questions about your relationship. Your answers become the building blocks of your vows."
  - q: "What if my partner and I want similar length vows?"
    a: "Aim for the same range, like 1 to 2 minutes each. Vows.you shows read-time feedback so you can both check your length without sharing content."

## Overview: Vows.you vs Easy Peasy {#overview}

[Easy Peasy](https://easy-peasy.ai/templates/wedding-vow-generator) is a general-purpose AI writing platform with dozens of templates, including a wedding vow generator. You fill in fields like your names, how long you have been together, what you love most, special memories, and your preferred tone. The tool generates a draft based on those inputs.

Vows.you is built for one purpose: wedding vows. Instead of a form that produces output, vows.you walks you through guided prompts that help you write in your own voice. Then it reviews what you wrote, flags cliches and weak phrases, and helps you practice and print. The core difference is depth. Easy Peasy gives you a fast starting point. Vows.you helps you refine, practice, and deliver. If you have ever gotten a generated draft that felt "close but not quite right," that refinement layer is what bridges the gap.

- Easy Peasy: general AI template platform with a vow generator form
- Vows.you: vow-specific workflow with writing, review, practice, and print
- Both can help you get past a blank page, but in different ways

## What Vows.you and Easy Peasy each do well {#strengths}

Easy Peasy is fast. If you want a vow draft in two minutes, their form gets you there. You type a few details, pick a tone, and get output. For people who just need a starting point to rewrite from, that speed is genuinely useful. They also mention an advanced AI model toggle for higher quality output, which signals they are investing in generation quality. And because Easy Peasy is a larger template library, you might already use it for other writing tasks.

Vows.you trades speed for depth. The guided prompts take longer than filling in a form, but they produce vows grounded in your specific relationship. After writing, cliche detection flags phrases like "you are my rock" and "forever and always" and suggests where to add personal details. The practice teleprompter and vow cards tool complete the workflow. You do not need to switch between apps to go from writing to rehearsing to printing. That continuity matters when you are working on something this personal.

- Easy Peasy: speed, simplicity, multiple AI templates
- Vows.you: cliche detection, guided prompts, practice tool, vow cards

## Biggest drawbacks of Easy Peasy {#drawbacks}

Easy Peasy's biggest limitation is that a template form can only go as deep as the inputs you type. If your answers are short or generic, the output will be too. That is not a flaw in the tool itself. It is a structural limit of the form-based approach.

It does not focus on vow-specific mistakes and cliches the way vows.you does. A general AI model will happily generate "you are my better half" and "I promise to love you unconditionally" because those phrases appear frequently in its training data. Without a filter designed for vow writing, generic language slips through. The tool is also not built around delivery. There is no practice mode, no teleprompter, and no print formatting. If you want to practice reading out loud or print vow cards, you need separate tools. The advanced model toggle and account creation also add steps before you reach the output.

- Output quality depends heavily on your input quality
- No vow-specific cliche detection or weak phrase feedback
- No practice teleprompter or vow card print tool
- Account creation and model toggle add friction

## Vows.you features that matter in real ceremonies {#vows-you-features}

The difference between "good enough" vows and vows you are proud of usually comes down to a few specific features.

Cliche detection catches the phrases that make vows sound like everyone else's. Click highlights show you where to swap in personal details. The [free vows template](https://www.vows.you/wedding-vows-template) asks guided prompts and produces a clear, modern vow about two minutes long. The [practice tool](https://www.vows.you/practice-wedding-vows) is a teleprompter with word-by-word highlighting, speed presets, fullscreen, and mirror mode. The [vow cards tool](https://www.vows.you/wedding-vow-cards) exports a PDF as a 4x6 card or half-letter booklet. You choose the background, overlay, and font. Everything runs in your browser. Your vows never leave your device. That privacy piece matters when you are writing something this intimate.

- Cliche detection and weak phrase highlighting
- Length and read-time feedback while you write
- Practice teleprompter with speed presets and mirror mode
- Vow cards PDF in 4x6 or half-letter booklet format
- Privacy: everything stays in your browser

## Vows.you vs Easy Peasy writing quality and "sounds like you" {#writing-quality}

Easy Peasy generates a draft. Vows.you helps you write one. That distinction matters more than it sounds.

A generated draft from a form tends to sound polished but impersonal. It uses the details you typed, but the sentence structures and transitions come from patterns the model learned across thousands of writing samples. The result often reads like a greeting card with your name inserted. Vows.you takes a different approach. The guided prompts pull out specific memories, feelings, and promises. Then the review tool flags where your language drifts toward generic territory. The goal is not to produce perfect prose on the first try. It is to help you sound like yourself over multiple passes. That iterative process is what makes vows feel genuine when you read them out loud.

- Generated drafts often sound polished but impersonal
- Guided prompts produce drafts grounded in specific details
- The review tool catches where language drifts toward generic
- The best vows come from editing, not from a single generation

## Cliches and common vow mistakes: Vows.you vs Easy Peasy {#cliches}

"I promise to love you unconditionally." "You make me want to be a better person." "From this day forward." These are the phrases that show up when someone asks an AI to write vows without any guardrails.

Vows.you flags these and asks you to replace them. Instead of "I promise to love you unconditionally," try naming a time you chose to show up even when it was hard. Instead of "you make me a better person," name the specific way. "You taught me how to apologize" is more powerful and more honest. Easy Peasy does not include vow-specific quality control. It generates what the model thinks good vows sound like, based on training data that includes thousands of cliche-heavy vow examples. That is not the tool's fault, but it means you need to do the filtering yourself.

- "You are my rock" and "forever and always" are the most common vow cliches
- Vows.you flags them automatically and suggests specific alternatives
- Easy Peasy does not filter for vow-specific cliches
- You can still fix these manually, but automatic detection saves time

## Length and pacing: keeping vows to 1 to 2 minutes {#length}

If your vows run past two minutes, the room starts to drift. Shorter is almost always better.

Vows.you shows a live word count and estimated read time as you write. You can see exactly when you cross the two-minute mark and decide what to cut. This feedback loop during the writing process is more useful than a length preference set at the start. Easy Peasy does not clearly offer real-time length or pacing feedback. You get the output and then need to check the length yourself. That works, but it means an extra step each time you edit and regenerate.

- Target: 150 to 300 words, about 1 to 2 minutes
- Vows.you: live read-time feedback while writing
- Easy Peasy: no clear real-time length feedback
- Shorter vows are easier to deliver and easier to remember

## Practicing and delivery: reading out loud without rushing {#practice}

You can write the best vows in the world and still stumble through them if you have not practiced.

The vows.you [practice tool](https://www.vows.you/practice-wedding-vows) is a teleprompter built for this. It scrolls your vows at a pace you set, highlights each word, and supports fullscreen and mirror mode. Speed presets help you slow down because almost everyone reads too fast when they are nervous. You can practice on your phone, tablet, or laptop. Easy Peasy does not include any practice or delivery features. You would need to copy your vows into a separate app, or just read from your phone screen at the ceremony. That is fine, but a dedicated practice tool makes a noticeable difference in delivery confidence.

- Practice out loud at least five times before the ceremony
- Use speed presets to train yourself to slow down
- Fullscreen and mirror mode simulate the real moment
- Easy Peasy does not include a practice tool

## Printing and vow cards: ceremony-friendly formatting {#printing}

Reading vows off a phone screen looks awkward. A printed card or booklet looks intentional and gives you something to hold.

The vows.you [vow cards tool](https://www.vows.you/wedding-vow-cards) generates a PDF in 4x6 card or half-letter booklet format. You choose the background, overlay, and font. It supports basic formatting and everything is generated in your browser. Easy Peasy does not offer print formatting. You would need to paste your vows into a design tool and format them yourself. That is doable, but it adds time and decisions when you are already busy with wedding prep.

- 4x6 card or half-letter booklet PDF export
- Background, overlay, and font customization
- Generated in your browser for privacy
- Easy Peasy does not include print formatting

## Pricing and access: Vows.you vs Easy Peasy {#pricing}

Easy Peasy has a free tier with limited generations. You need to create an account and log in to access templates. Paid plans include more generations and access to their advanced AI model toggle.

Vows.you free tools do not require an account or login. The [vow template](https://www.vows.you/wedding-vows-template), [vow review](https://www.vows.you/free-wedding-vow-review), [practice tool](https://www.vows.you/practice-wedding-vows), and [vow cards](https://www.vows.you/wedding-vow-cards) all work immediately in your browser.

- Easy Peasy: free tier with account required, paid plans for more
- Vows.you: free tools with no account required
- Neither requires a credit card to start

## My take after reading a lot of vows {#author-take}

After watching couples struggle with this, one thing is clear. The people who use AI generators without any editing produce vows that sound fine but feel flat. The ones who use a tool that gives them feedback and then revise based on that feedback produce something meaningfully better.

The most common mistake is not bad writing. It is borrowed writing. People grab phrases they have heard at other weddings or seen on Pinterest boards, and those phrases do not carry any weight because they are not attached to a real memory. "You are my best friend and my soulmate" could be about anyone. "You are the person who drove four hours to bring me soup when I had the flu" could only be about one person. That specificity is what makes people cry at a wedding.

On delivery, here is the honest truth: you will be nervous. Your hands will shake. Your voice might crack. All of that is normal. Practice does not eliminate the nerves, but it makes the words feel familiar in your mouth so your body can do its thing while your brain stays on track. A teleprompter with speed control is the closest thing to a cheat code for ceremony delivery.

- Replace borrowed phrases with specific memories
- "You are my soulmate" becomes "you are the person who drove four hours to bring me soup"
- Practice out loud five or more times
- Speed presets on a teleprompter help retrain your pacing

## Who should pick Vows.you vs Easy Peasy {#who-should-pick}

If you want a fast AI-generated draft and plan to rewrite it heavily, Easy Peasy is a reasonable starting point. It is quick, the form is simple, and you can iterate from there.

If you want a tool that stays with you from first draft through delivery, vows.you covers more ground. The guided prompts help you write in your own voice. The review tool catches cliches before your partner hears them. The practice teleprompter builds delivery confidence. And the vow cards tool gives you something beautiful to hold at the ceremony. People who care about the final product, not just the first draft, will get the most from vows.you.

- Easy Peasy is best for a fast AI-generated starting point
- Vows.you is best for the full writing-to-delivery workflow
- You can use Easy Peasy for a first draft and then bring it into vows.you for review and practice
