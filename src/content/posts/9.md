Crying during your vows is completely normal. Here's how to handle it gracefully.

## Accept That It Might Happen

The more you fight tears, the harder they can hit. Accept that this is an emotional moment and that some tears are beautiful.

## Build in Pauses

Write your vows with natural breaking points. If you feel emotion rising, you can pause, take a breath, and continue.

## Practice Out Loud

Reading your vows aloud multiple times before the wedding helps you get through the emotional parts. You'll know which lines hit hardest.

## Have a Backup

Consider giving a copy to your officiant. If you truly can't continue, they can help you through it or read on your behalf.

## Remember: No One Minds

Your partner and guests understand. A few tears show how much this moment means to you. Take your time, breathe, and know that it's okay.

Tears are not a failure. They're proof that you mean every word.
