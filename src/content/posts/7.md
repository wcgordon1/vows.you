A strong ending leaves a lasting impression. Here's how to close your vows well.

## Return to the Beginning

If you started with a memory or image, consider calling back to it. This creates a sense of completeness, like the vows have come full circle.

"That day in traffic, I didn't know where we were going. Now I do. Wherever it is, I'm going with you."

## End with a Promise

Closing with a forward-looking promise emphasizes commitment. It transitions from reflecting on what brought you here to declaring what comes next.

"I choose you today. I'll choose you tomorrow. I'll keep choosing you."

## End with Love

Sometimes simple is powerful. Saying "I love you" as your final words lands with weight after everything you've shared.

## What to Avoid

Don't trail off. Don't add qualifiers at the end like "so, yeah" or "that's all I have." Don't rush through the ending because you're relieved to be almost done.

## Practice Your Ending

Know your last line cold. When nerves kick in, having a clear endpoint helps. You don't want to be searching for words when you should be landing the moment.

## Leave Space After

After your final words, pause. Let the moment breathe. Give your partner and your guests a beat to absorb what you've said. The silence is part of the ending.

The closing is your chance to leave your partner with something that resonates. Make it count.
