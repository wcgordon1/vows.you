YouTube is the long game. You publish a video, it picks up search traffic slowly, and six months later it's pulling in more views than it did on upload day. That's the whole appeal  -  and it's also what makes affiliate links on YouTube weirdly effective.

A link in your video description doesn't expire. It sits there, earning clicks, for as long as the video exists. Pair that with a 90-day cookie window and a $51.60 commission per sale, and a single video can quietly generate income for years.

Let's break down how this works in practice.

## What Vows.you pays

- **Product price:** $129
- **Your commission:** 40% = $51.60
- **Cookie window:** 90 days
- **Cost to join:** $0

No tiers. No minimum thresholds to start earning (though payouts process once you hit $50). No hoops.

## Video formats that drive affiliate clicks

Not every video type converts the same way. Here's what we've seen work for wedding YouTube channels:

### The vow-writing tutorial

Title something like "How to Write Wedding Vows (Step by Step)" or "Wedding Vow Writing Tips from a Real Planner." Walk through the process. Mention Vows.you as the tool you recommend. Link in description. This format has strong search intent  -  people typing this into YouTube are stuck and looking for help.

### Ceremony reaction videos

React to real wedding vow readings. Talk about what worked, what felt rushed, what made you cry. At the end: "If you want help writing yours, I use Vows.you  -  link below." The emotional content does the heavy lifting. The recommendation feels earned.

### Wedding planning vlogs

If you're documenting your own wedding journey or working with couples, show the vow-writing process as part of the planning timeline. Organic, real, not staged. "We finally sat down and wrote our vows using this tool" with a quick screen share or mention.

### "Things I wish I'd known" videos

These perform because they're search-optimized and emotionally resonant. "5 Things I Wish I Knew Before Writing My Wedding Vows"  -  include "use a structured tool instead of staring at a blank page" as one of the five. Link to Vows.you.

### Top wedding tools roundups

"Best Wedding Planning Tools in 2026"  -  include Vows.you in your list alongside budgeting apps, seating chart tools, and playlist builders. These videos rank for broad wedding keywords and pick up traffic from couples at every stage of planning.

## Where to place the link

**Video description  -  first three lines.** YouTube only shows the first 2-3 lines of your description before "Show more." Put your affiliate link there. Don't bury it.

**Pinned comment.** Pin a comment with your top recommendations and include the link. Pinned comments get seen  -  especially on tutorial content where people scroll to the comments for resources.

**End screen verbal CTA.** In the last 30 seconds: "If you're working on your vows, I'll put a link to Vows.you in the description. It walks you through the whole process and saves you a lot of blank-page panic." Keep it natural.

**Chapter markers.** If you're doing a tutorial, add a chapter where you demo or mention Vows.you. People who skip to that section are high-intent.

## Why the 90-day cookie changes everything on YouTube

Here's the thing about YouTube traffic. Someone watches your vow-writing video eight months before their wedding. They're not buying a vow-writing tool that day. They're browsing. They're in research mode.

With a 24-hour cookie (like Amazon), that viewer would never convert for you. They'd click your link, leave, and buy three months later with no attribution.

With a 90-day cookie, that viewer clicks in January, forgets about it, comes back in March when they're actually writing their vows, and buys. You get the $51.60. That's how wedding purchase cycles work, and the cookie window matches it.

This is especially powerful on YouTube because your videos keep getting recommended. A video you published six months ago surfaces for a viewer today, they click your link, and the 90-day window starts fresh for that viewer.

## Realistic income projections

Let's use conservative numbers for a wedding YouTube channel with 5,000 subscribers:

**Scenario: One well-performing vow tutorial**

- 10,000 lifetime views (over 12 months)
- 2% click-through to description link = 200 clicks
- 4% conversion rate = 8 sales
- 8 × $51.60 = **$412.80 from one video**

**Scenario: Five videos mentioning Vows.you across a year**

- Combined 40,000 views
- 1.5% CTR = 600 clicks
- 3% conversion = 18 sales
- 18 × $51.60 = **$928.80/year**

And those videos don't stop getting views. Year two, year three  -  the links keep working.

Nobody's retiring off affiliate income from a 5K-subscriber channel. But $900/year from links you placed once? That's equipment upgrades. That's software subscriptions. That's not nothing.
