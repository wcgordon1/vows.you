Promises are the core of wedding vows. They're what turn a nice speech into a commitment. Here's how to write promises that matter.

## Be Specific

"I promise to love you forever" is nice but vague. What does love look like in your daily life together? "I promise to bring you coffee every morning" or "I promise to always take your side, even when you're wrong" says more about who you are as a couple.

## Be Realistic

Promise things you can actually deliver. Grand gestures sound impressive, but small, consistent actions build a marriage. Think about what you can commit to doing every day, not just on your best days.

## Think About the Hard Times

Some of the most powerful promises acknowledge that things won't always be easy. "I promise to choose us, even when it's hard" or "I promise to keep talking, even when I'd rather shut down" shows maturity and commitment.

## Include Different Types of Promises

Mix practical promises with emotional ones. Promise how you'll show up in daily life. Promise how you'll handle conflict. Promise how you'll support their dreams. Promise something specific to your relationship.

## The Number of Promises

Three to five promises is usually the right amount. Enough to feel substantial, not so many that they lose impact or become a list.

## Test Your Promises

Read them aloud. Do they sound like things you actually want to say? Would you be proud to hear your partner make these promises to you? If yes, you're on the right track.
