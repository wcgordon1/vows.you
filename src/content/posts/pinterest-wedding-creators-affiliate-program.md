Pinterest is weird compared to every other platform. A pin you post today can drive traffic 18 months from now. There's no algorithm decay the way there is on Instagram or TikTok. Wedding pins, specifically, have some of the longest lifespans on the entire platform because engaged couples are constantly searching for the same things.

That makes Pinterest quietly perfect for affiliate marketing — especially for a product like Vows.you where the buyer isn't in a rush.

## Why Pinterest + wedding affiliates is such a good fit

Three things make this combination work:

**1. Intent is baked into the platform.**

People on Pinterest aren't scrolling to kill time (okay, some are). But the majority of users who land on wedding content are actively planning. They're looking for ideas, tools, checklists, and resources. They're in buying mode — or at least in "save this for later" mode, which the 90-day cookie covers.

**2. Pins don't die.**

Your Instagram story vanishes in 24 hours. Your TikTok gets buried after a week. A Pinterest pin about wedding vow writing tips? It can show up in search results for years. Every pin you create with your affiliate link is a long-term asset, not a one-time post.

**3. Wedding is Pinterest's bread and butter.**

"Wedding" is consistently one of the top search categories on Pinterest. The audience is already there, already searching, already saving pins about vow ideas, ceremony planning, and wedding prep. You're meeting them exactly where they're looking.

## What to pin

Let's talk specifics. Here are pin types that drive affiliate clicks:

### Idea pins with vow-writing tips

Create a multi-slide idea pin: "5 Prompts to Help You Start Writing Your Wedding Vows." Give real value. On the last slide: "For the full guided process, try Vows.you — link in bio" or link directly if the format allows it.

### Infographic pins

Design a clean, vertical infographic: "How Long Should Wedding Vows Be?" or "Wedding Vow Writing Timeline — When to Start and When to Finish." Include your affiliate link as the destination URL. These get saved and reshared constantly.

### Blog post pins

If you have a blog, write a post about vow writing (or update an existing one) and add your Vows.you affiliate link within the content. Then create 3-5 pin variations that all link to that blog post. Different titles, different images, same destination. This gives you multiple entry points from Pinterest search.

### Curated board strategy

Create a board called "Wedding Vow Writing" or "How to Write Your Own Vows." Pin your own content alongside popular ceremony pins. Make your affiliate-linked pins the top ones. People who find your board are exactly the audience who'd buy Vows.you.

### Quote and text overlay pins

"The hardest part of writing your vows is starting." Overlay text on a soft wedding photo. Link goes to your affiliate URL. Simple to create, high save rate, and they attract the exact people who are stuck on vow writing.

## Pin SEO: keywords that matter

Pinterest is a search engine. Treat it like one. Use these keywords in your pin titles, descriptions, and board names:

- wedding vow writing tips
- how to write personal wedding vows
- wedding vow ideas
- wedding vow prompts
- wedding vow template
- writing vows for him / for her
- wedding vow examples personal
- how to start wedding vows
- wedding ceremony vows
- DIY wedding vows

Sprinkle these naturally through your pin descriptions. Don't keyword-stuff — Pinterest's algorithm is smarter than that now. Write descriptions that read like helpful sentences, not keyword lists.

## The compounding effect

Here's what most people miss about Pinterest affiliate marketing.

Month one, you create 10 pins. They get some impressions, a few clicks. Not exciting.

Month three, those 10 pins have been indexed. They're showing up in search. You've added 20 more pins. Now you have 30 assets working for you.

Month six, your best-performing pins are getting reshared by other users. Your boards are ranking. You're getting clicks you didn't actively generate.

Month twelve, you have 60+ pins across multiple boards, all pointing to your affiliate link or to blog posts containing your affiliate link. The traffic is steady and growing without you creating new content every day.

This is the opposite of Instagram or TikTok, where you're on a content treadmill. Pinterest rewards consistency and patience. The work you do now pays off for months and years.

## Realistic numbers

A Pinterest account focused on wedding content with 50,000 monthly impressions:

- **1% click-through** = 500 clicks/month
- Assuming **3% of clicks** go to your affiliate link = 15 affiliate clicks
- **5% conversion** = 0.75 sales/month

That's about $39/month or **$464/year** — and those numbers grow as your pin library grows. Creators with 200,000+ monthly impressions can realistically 4x–5x those figures.

The key insight: you're not relying on any single pin to go viral. You're building a library. Each pin is a small, persistent traffic source. They add up.

## How to get started

1. **[Apply to the Vows.you affiliate program](https://vows.affonso.io/)** — free, takes two minutes
2. **Create your first 5 pins** — use the content ideas above
3. **Optimize your boards** — create or rename a board for vow-writing content
4. **Link everything properly** — direct pins to your affiliate URL or to blog posts with embedded affiliate links
5. **Keep pinning** — 3-5 new pins per week is plenty. Consistency over volume.

Pinterest is a slow build, but it's a durable one. Every pin you create today is an asset that can drive affiliate income for the next two years. In a space as evergreen as wedding planning, that's about as close to passive income as it gets.
