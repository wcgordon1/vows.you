The blank page is intimidating. Where do you even begin? Here are some opening approaches that work.

## Start with a Memory

Begin with a specific moment from your relationship. The first time you met. The moment you knew. A small, seemingly ordinary day that meant everything.

"I remember the first time you made me laugh. We were stuck in traffic, and I thought, I could do this forever."

## Start with Your Partner

Address them directly. Say their name. Acknowledge where you are and what's happening.

"Alex, standing here with you, I keep thinking about everything that brought us to this moment."

## Start with a Feeling

Name what you're experiencing right now. Nervous? Grateful? Overwhelmed with joy? Starting with honesty about your feelings creates immediate connection.

"I've been nervous about this moment for weeks. But looking at you now, I just feel calm."

## What to Avoid

Don't start with a joke unless you're very confident it will land. Don't apologize for being nervous or for not being a good writer. Don't open with something generic like "I always knew I'd find someone like you."

## The First Line Matters Less Than You Think

Once you start writing, you might find your opening changes. That's okay. Often the real opening reveals itself after you've written the middle. Give yourself permission to start anywhere and rearrange later.

The best opening is one that sounds like you and draws your partner in. Trust that you'll find it.
