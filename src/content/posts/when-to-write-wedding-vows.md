If you’re wondering **when** to write your wedding vows, you’re already ahead of most people.

The biggest mistake isn’t “bad writing.” It’s waiting until the week-of, when your brain is fried from planning and your emotions are running hot. The fix is simple: **start earlier than you think, draft sooner than you want, and polish later than you expect**.

Below is a timeline that keeps you calm, keeps your vows “you,” and keeps them ceremony-friendly.

---

## The “good vows” goal (so the timeline makes sense)

Before we talk dates, lock the target:

- **Length:** about **1–2 minutes** spoken aloud, which is roughly **150–300 words** for most people.  
  - The Knot recommends ~**250–300 words** (about **2 minutes**) using an average pace of **125–150 words per minute**. [^1]  
  - Zola suggests most vows are **1–2 minutes** (about **150–250 words**), and separately notes many couples fall in **30 seconds to 3 minutes** depending on style. [^2] [^3]  
- **Pace matters:** average U.S. English speech is often cited around **150 words per minute**, and many speaking guides suggest slowing slightly for clarity. [^4] [^5]  
- **Structure matters more than “poetry”:** a simple arc (opening → story → promises → closing) is what keeps vows clear under emotion and nerves. [^6]

If you want a guided flow that keeps you on track (tone, length, structure, practice timing), you can use <a href="https://www.vows.you/" target="_blank">vows.you</a> as your “railroad tracks” while you write. It’s designed to keep your voice intact—just clearer.

## The best time to start: **8–12 weeks before the wedding**

This is the sweet spot because it gives you time for:
- reflection (the good stuff),
- distance (so you can edit without overthinking),
- and practice (so you don’t rush).

Vogue’s professional vow-writer guidance commonly points to starting **up to ~three months** in advance so you’re not forcing it under pressure. [^6]

### What to do at 8–12 weeks (60 minutes total)
Do this in 2–3 short sessions:

1) **Brain-dump memories**
   - first impression / first “oh wow” moment  
   - a hard season you survived  
   - a small daily thing you love (the unglamorous truth)  
   - a moment you felt chosen  
   Vogue explicitly recommends a “brain dump” of memories and moments before you format anything. [^6]

2) **Pick 3–5 promise categories**
   - “How I’ll treat you”
   - “How we’ll handle conflict”
   - “How I’ll support your dreams”
   - “How I’ll show up day-to-day”
   The Knot suggests **3–6 promises** is a practical range. [^7]

3) **Agree on guardrails with your partner**
   - target length (e.g., ~2 minutes each)
   - tone (heartfelt, funny-light, modern-minimal)
   - any hard “don’t go there” topics (exes, trauma details, private family stuff)

This one conversation prevents the most common vow problem: **one person does 45 seconds and the other does 6 minutes.**

---

## First draft: **4–6 weeks before**

This is where you stop thinking and start writing.

### What to do at 4–6 weeks (45 minutes)
Write a draft that hits this outline:

1) **One-line opening**
2) **Mini story** (2–4 sentences)
3) **What I love about you** (2–3 specifics)
4) **Promises** (3–6)
5) **Close** (1–2 lines)

The Knot’s vow-writing guidance emphasizes reflecting on your past, stating what you love, then moving into specific vows and future. [^7]

**Important:** This draft does *not* need to be perfect. It needs to be **true** and **specific**.

If you want to make drafting feel easy, <a href="https://www.vows.you/" target="_blank">vows.you</a> is built exactly for this stage—prompts → structure → a coherent draft you can refine.

---

## Revision + timing: **10–14 days before**

Now you turn “good words” into “good vows.”

### Why 10–14 days is magic
Because you can read it aloud multiple times and still have room to cut/edit without panic.

Zola explicitly recommends timing yourself and keeping vows in a practical spoken range. [^2]

### What to do in the 10–14 day window
1) **Read aloud with a timer**
   - Aim: **~1:30–2:15** (unless you both agree on longer)
   - If you’re around **2:45–3:00**, you’re probably repeating yourself.

2) **Cut any “throat-clearing” lines**
   - “I don’t even know where to start…”
   - “I wrote and rewrote this…”
   - “Everyone says marriage is hard…”
   Keep one if it feels authentic. Cut the rest.

3) **Add one “only us” detail**
   - a tiny tradition
   - a specific trip moment
   - a shared phrase
   This is what guests remember.

4) **Print or format a clean reading copy**
   - Big enough text
   - clear line breaks
   - no dense paragraphs

---

## Final polish: **2–3 days before**

At this point, you’re not rewriting. You’re removing friction.

### What to do 2–3 days before
- Do one “final” read aloud at your real pace.
- Mark breath points (slashes or bolded first words).
- Put it in your ceremony bag (plus a backup copy).

---

## If you’re behind: three realistic “late timelines”

### Option A: You have **7 days**
- Day 1: brain dump
- Day 2: first draft
- Day 3: cut + structure
- Day 4: read aloud + time
- Day 5: tighten wording
- Day 6: final reading copy
- Day 7: one calm practice

WeddingWire even has a “procrastinator” vow guide for couples who need a structured approach quickly. [^8]

### Option B: You have **48 hours**
- Write the simplest version:
  - 1 story
  - 3 promises
  - 1 close  
Keep it under 2 minutes.

### Option C: You’re anxious about public vows
Private vow exchanges before the ceremony are a real trend, and can reduce performance pressure while keeping ceremony vows simpler. [^9]

---

## Why “starting earlier” actually helps (not just planner advice)

Two useful research-adjacent ideas that support the “start early, reflect, then draft” approach:

- **Expressive writing** research suggests writing about emotional experiences can change how people communicate and process feelings. (This is not wedding-specific, but it supports the idea that reflection improves clarity.) [^10] [^11]  
- Relationship science has also long studied **self-disclosure** as central to closeness and liking—again, not wedding-vow-specific, but aligned with why personal specificity lands. [^12]

Translation: **You don’t need to be a writer. You need time to remember the real stuff.**

## A simple checklist you can follow

### 8–12 weeks out
- [ ] Brain dump: 10 memories + 10 traits
- [ ] Pick tone: heartfelt / funny-light / modern-minimal
- [ ] Agree on length target (ex: ~2 minutes)

### 4–6 weeks out
- [ ] Draft with structure (opening → story → promises → close)
- [ ] Keep promises 3–6

### 10–14 days out
- [ ] Time it aloud
- [ ] Cut repeats
- [ ] Add 1 “only us” detail

### 2–3 days out
- [ ] Final reading copy
- [ ] Backup copy saved

If you want this checklist baked into the writing process (with prompts, structure, and a timing/practice mode), that’s exactly what <a href="https://www.vows.you/" target="_blank">vows.you</a> is built for.
