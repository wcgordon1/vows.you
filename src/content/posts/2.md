Humor can be a beautiful part of wedding vows. It shows the real texture of your relationship. But there's a fine line between funny and cringe. Here's how to walk it.

## Start with What's True

The best wedding humor comes from real moments in your relationship. That time you got lost on your first trip together. The ongoing debate about the thermostat. Your partner's inexplicable love of a terrible movie.

Real stories land better than generic jokes. They show your guests who you actually are together.

## Balance Funny with Heartfelt

A vow that's all jokes can feel like you're avoiding vulnerability. Aim for a mix: maybe one or two funny moments, surrounded by genuine promises and sincere feelings.

Think of humor as seasoning, not the main course.

## Know Your Audience

Remember that your vows are for your partner, but you're also speaking in front of family and friends. Inside jokes are great, but make sure the humor translates. Avoid anything that might embarrass your partner or make guests uncomfortable.

## Test It Out

Read your vows aloud to a trusted friend. If they laugh, great. If they cringe, revise. Sometimes what sounds funny in your head doesn't land the same way out loud.

## Trust Your Voice

If you're naturally funny, let that come through. If you're not, don't force it. The goal is to sound like yourself, whatever that looks like.

The best vows feel authentic. If humor is part of your relationship, include it. If it's not, don't worry about being funny. Be you.
