Don't wait until the week before your wedding to write your vows. Here's a timeline that works.

## 2-3 Months Before

Start thinking about what you want to say. Jot down memories, feelings, and promises as they come to you. Don't worry about structure yet.

## 1-2 Months Before

Start drafting. Get your thoughts into sentences. Don't edit heavily yet. Just get words on paper.

## 3-4 Weeks Before

Shape your draft into a structure. Opening, memories, promises, closing. Start cutting what doesn't fit.

## 2 Weeks Before

Read your vows aloud. Time them. Edit for length and flow. Make sure they feel natural to speak.

## 1 Week Before

Finalize your vows. Print them or write them on nice paper. Practice reading them a few times each day.

## The Day Before

One final read-through. Then put them away and trust that you're ready.

Starting early gives you time to live with your words and refine them without pressure.
