Writing your vows is half the work. Delivering them well is the other half. Here's how to practice so you feel ready.

## Read Aloud, Not Just in Your Head

The first time you read your vows aloud might feel awkward. That's normal. Your voice, your pacing, and your emotions all work differently when you speak versus when you read silently. Practice out loud multiple times.

## Time Yourself

Know how long your vows take. Most vows should be 1 to 3 minutes. If yours are running long, edit. If they're very short, consider adding more. Having a sense of timing helps you pace yourself on the day.

## Practice with Emotion

Don't just read the words mechanically. Let yourself feel what you're saying. This will help you identify the moments where you might get choked up, so they don't surprise you at the altar.

## Plan for Tears

If you're someone who cries, that's okay. Build in pauses. Know where you might need to take a breath. Consider having a handkerchief or tissues nearby. Crying is beautiful, not something to be embarrassed about.

## Practice Eye Contact

On your ceremony day, you'll want to look at your partner, not just stare at your paper. Practice looking up between sentences. Some people print their vows in a larger font to make this easier.

## Don't Over-Practice

You want to feel familiar with your vows, not robotic. A few run-throughs each day in the week before your wedding is enough. You want to sound natural, like you're speaking from the heart.

## Trust Yourself

By the time you're standing up there, you'll have lived with these words for a while. Trust that they'll come. Your partner isn't grading you. They just want to hear your voice and your love.
