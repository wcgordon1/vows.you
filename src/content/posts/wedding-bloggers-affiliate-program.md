If you write about weddings, you've probably published some version of "how to write your wedding vows" or "wedding vow examples." Those posts pull steady organic traffic because couples search for this stuff constantly.

You're sitting on prime real estate. Right now, that traffic hits your page, reads your advice, and leaves. Maybe they click an ad banner worth $0.03. Maybe they don't.

Here's a better option.

## The basics

Vows.you pays 40% commission on every sale. The product costs $129. That's $51.60 in your pocket per conversion.

The cookie window is 90 days. When a reader clicks your affiliate link, they have three full months to come back and purchase. You still get credited. This matters because people reading "how to write wedding vows" are usually months away from their wedding. They're researching. They're not buying today. But they will buy — and when they do, your referral tracks.

No sign-up fee. No monthly cost. You apply, get approved, place your links, and earn.

## Where to put your links (and where not to)

The most effective placement isn't a banner ad at the top of your page. Readers are blind to those. What works:

**In-content recommendations.** When you're writing about vow structure or prompts, that's where you say "Vows.you walks you through this step by step" with a link. It reads like a genuine recommendation because — ideally — it is one.

**Resource roundups.** If you have a "best wedding planning tools" or "wedding vow writing resources" post, add Vows.you with a short honest review. These posts rank well and attract high-intent readers.

**At the end of how-to posts.** After you've given your advice on writing vows, add a line like "If you want guided prompts that do the heavy lifting, check out Vows.you." Natural. Not pushy.

**Where it doesn't work:** Popups. Sidebar widgets nobody looks at. Random posts about wedding venues where vow-writing has nothing to do with the topic.

Context matters. Match the link to the content.

## SEO angles you're probably not targeting

You already rank for some wedding keywords. But there's long-tail traffic that converts especially well for this kind of affiliate offer:

- "wedding vow generator"
- "how to write vows when you're not a writer"
- "wedding vow prompts"
- "personal wedding vows examples"
- "how to start writing wedding vows"
- "wedding vow template free"

These search queries signal intent. Someone typing "how to start writing wedding vows" is stuck. They need help. That's the exact moment Vows.you solves a problem, and your affiliate link bridges the gap.

Write content around these queries. Link to Vows.you where it fits. Let Google do the rest.

## How this compares to display ads

Let's be honest about the math.

A wedding blog with 10,000 monthly visitors might earn $50–$150/month from display ads (Mediavine, AdSense, whatever). That's $0.005–$0.015 per pageview.

Now imagine 500 of those visitors land on your vow-writing content. If 3% click your affiliate link and 5% of those convert:

- 500 readers → 15 clicks → 0.75 sales/month

That's roughly $39/month from one article. Not life-changing, but it's competitive with what your entire display ad setup earns — from a single post.

And that's conservative. If your vow content gets 2,000 monthly visitors (very achievable for a post ranking on page one), the numbers scale:

- 2,000 readers → 60 clicks → 3 sales → **$154.80/month**

From one article. With links you placed once.

## What makes this different from other affiliate programs

I've seen a lot of wedding affiliate programs. Most of them pay 5–10% on physical products with a 7-day cookie. You send someone to a registry site, they browse for three weeks, finally buy a $200 blender, and you get nothing because the cookie expired.

Vows.you is digital, so the margins support a 40% payout. The 90-day cookie exists because the team understands how wedding planning timelines work. And the product itself — guided vow-writing prompts — is genuinely useful. Your readers will actually thank you for recommending it. That doesn't happen with most affiliate products.

## Getting started

1. **[Apply here](https://vows.affonso.io/)** — takes two minutes, no fee
2. **Get your unique link** — you'll have dashboard access to track clicks and conversions
3. **Add links to your existing vow content** — start with your highest-traffic posts
4. **Write new content targeting vow-related keywords** — the long-tail stuff converts

You don't need to overhaul your blog. You need to add a few well-placed links to content that already exists and create one or two new posts targeting keywords your readers are already searching for.

The traffic is there. The product is solid. The commission is generous. The rest is just placing the links.
