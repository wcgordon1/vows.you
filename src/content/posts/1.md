One of the most common questions couples ask is: how long should my vows be? The answer depends on your ceremony style, your comfort level, and what you want to say.

## The Sweet Spot

Most wedding vows land between 1 and 3 minutes when read aloud. That's roughly 150 to 400 words. This length gives you enough time to say something meaningful without losing your audience or your composure.

## Why Length Matters

Too short and your vows might feel rushed or incomplete. Too long and you risk losing the emotional impact. The goal is to find the length that lets you express what matters most without overstaying your welcome.

## Timing Tips

When you practice reading your vows aloud, you'll naturally speak slower than you think. Emotions, pauses, and the weight of the moment all add time. If your vows take 2 minutes in practice, expect closer to 2.5 or 3 minutes on the day.

## Matching Your Partner

You and your partner don't need identical vow lengths, but being in the same ballpark helps the ceremony feel balanced. Aim for within 30 seconds of each other.

## Finding Your Length

Start by writing everything you want to say without worrying about length. Then edit down to the essentials. Ask yourself: what are the 3 or 4 things I most want my partner to hear? Build around those.

The right length is the one that lets you say what you mean without running out of words or breath. Trust yourself.
