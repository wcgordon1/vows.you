You know those DMs you get from followers freaking out about writing their vows? The ones where they ask if you have a template or if you know anyone who can help?

That's money you're leaving on the table. Not in a gross way — in a "you're already doing the work, you might as well get compensated" way.

Vows.you has an affiliate program that pays 40% commission. The product is $129. You do the math: $51.60 per sale. Every time someone clicks your link and buys within 90 days, you get paid.

## Why this actually works on TikTok

Most affiliate stuff doesn't translate well to short-form video. Nobody wants to watch a 60-second ad for a random product. But wedding vow content? That's already your lane.

Here's what performs:

- **"Things I wish I knew before writing my vows"** — drop your affiliate link in bio
- **Duets with ceremony clips** — react to good (or bad) vow delivery and mention Vows.you as a resource
- **Get-ready-with-me content** — show the vow-writing process, mention what tool you used
- **Story time about a ceremony gone wrong** — the couple who didn't practice, the vows that went too long

You're not selling. You're talking about what you already talk about. The link just sits in your bio.

## The 90-day cookie thing matters more than you think

On Amazon affiliates, someone has to buy within 24 hours of clicking your link. Twenty-four hours. For a couple who's probably 6 months out from their wedding.

Vows.you gives you 90 days. That's the whole engagement-to-wedding pipeline for a lot of couples. They see your TikTok in March, click the link, bookmark it, and buy in May when they actually sit down to write. You still get the $51.60.

Wedding purchases aren't impulse buys. The cookie window reflects that.

## How to set it up

1. **Apply at [vows.you/wedding-affiliate](/wedding-affiliate)** — takes about two minutes
2. **Get approved** — we review applications within 48 hours
3. **Add your link to your bio** — use a link-in-bio tool if you're managing multiple links
4. **Create content you'd make anyway** — just mention Vows.you where it fits naturally

That's it. No discount codes to manage, no inventory, no customer service on your end.

## What the numbers look like

Let's say you have 10,000 followers. A solid wedding TikTok gets maybe 50,000–100,000 views if it catches. Even conservatively:

- **50,000 views** on a TikTok
- **1% click through** to your bio link = 500 clicks
- **3% conversion** = 15 sales
- **15 × $51.60** = **$774 from one video**

And that video keeps getting views. TikTok surfaces old content all the time. One viral vow-writing TikTok from three months ago can still drive clicks today.

I'm not saying every video hits like this. But you only need a few to make it worthwhile.

## Content ideas that actually convert

Skip the hard sell. Nobody on TikTok wants to feel like they're watching QVC. Instead:

**Talk about the problem.** Most couples have no idea how to start writing vows. They google "wedding vow examples," copy something generic, and regret it later. That's the pain point.

**Show the solution casually.** "I used Vows.you to figure out what I actually wanted to say" or "I recommend this to every couple I work with." Done. No script needed.

**Reply to comments with content.** When someone comments "how do I write my vows??" — make a reply video. Walk through it. Mention Vows.you. Pin the comment.

**Use trending sounds.** Take whatever audio is trending and put it over text about vow-writing struggles. The relatability does the selling for you.

## Who this is best for

You don't need a million followers. Honestly, micro-creators in the wedding space often convert better because their audience trusts them more. If you're a:

- Wedding content creator posting ceremony clips
- Bride or groom documenting your own wedding journey
- Wedding videographer sharing behind-the-scenes
- Officiant talking about what makes ceremonies good

...this is built for you. Your audience is already in the buying mindset. They're planning a wedding. They need help with vows. You're just connecting the dots.
