Second marriages bring unique considerations to vow writing. Here's how to approach them thoughtfully.

## Acknowledge the Journey

Your path to this moment includes experiences that shaped who you are. You don't need to dwell on the past, but you can acknowledge that you've both grown and learned.

## Focus on What You've Found

What makes this relationship different? What have you discovered about love, partnership, and yourself? Let your vows celebrate what you've found in each other.

## Include Children If Appropriate

If either of you has children, consider how to honor them in your ceremony. Some couples include family vows alongside their vows to each other.

## Be Authentic

Don't try to recreate your first wedding or pretend the past didn't happen. Embrace where you are now. Your vows should reflect the wisdom and gratitude you bring to this new chapter.

The best vows for a second marriage celebrate growth, resilience, and the joy of finding love again.
