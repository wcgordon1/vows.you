## Privacy & Your Vows

### Your Vows Are Private
Your wedding vows are deeply personal. We treat them that way.

- We **never read, share, or sell** your vow content.
- Your drafts are **not used** for marketing, training, or any other purpose.
- Only **you** can access your workspace and drafts.

### Data Security
We take reasonable measures to protect your account and content:
- All data is transmitted over **encrypted connections (HTTPS)**.
- Passwords are hashed and never stored in plain text.
- We use secure, trusted infrastructure to host your data.

### Deleting Your Account
If you choose to delete your account:
1. Email **hello@vows.you** with your request.
2. We'll permanently delete all your drafts, account data, and personal information.
3. This action is irreversible — we don't keep backups of deleted accounts.

### Payment Security
We never store your credit card or payment details. All transactions are processed through our secure third-party payment provider.
